# Portfolio

This is my first attempt at a developer portfolio. I've included a header with a photo of myself, my name, and a nav bar with links that scroll to their respective sections of the page.

In the About Me section, I give a brief description about myself and my aspirations and where I hope to go after I complete this coding bootcamp.

In the My Work section, I added linked images. The top image links to my deployed project where I refactored the HTML to be more semantic. The other two images are placeholder images for future projects.

The Contact Me section has three links that each link to my email, twitter, and GitHub profile.
